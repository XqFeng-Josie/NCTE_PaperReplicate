      "teacher: Okay.  Math should be out.  Everything else, please put away. I need Student E, Student H over here.  Student B, on the floor.  You can have your math packets.  And I need Student J over here and Student O over here.  [Inaudible.] All right.    [Inaudible] no glasses.  Student D, I need you to completely turn around a little since you’re not used to sitting there like that, in that seat.  Okay. Let’s turn to page 53.  Today we’re going to work on seeing what happens, determine the effect.  See what happens to the product when a factor is doubled or it’s halved.  We’re going to talk some more about that like we did last week. And we’re going to develop more strategies for multiplying that involves breaking numbers [inaudible].  When we do that, of course we’re always going to be looking at demonstrating, explaining your strategies for when you’re multiplying or dividing.  Okay.  So math, page 53.  We have this problem on that page.  16 times 3 and 16 times 6. Let’s take a look at that one again.  That was which one on page 53 is that?\n",
      "student: C.\n",
      "teacher: C?  Okay.  How are they related to each other?  How are the problems related and how are the two answers related? Student M?\n",
      "student: Because 16 times 3 and 16 times 6, they both involve 16.\n",
      "teacher: They both have one factor of 16.  Okay.  What else?  How else are they related, Student C?\n",
      "student: Because 16 stays the same but your actually getting the answer to – if you look at the second one and if you know it, you can just like cut it in half and then you have the answer for the first one.\n",
      "teacher: Okay.  So looking at the second problem, the equation, if you know that, you cut it in half – why can you do that?  So you’re looking at the answer here, is half of the answer to the second one?\n",
      "student: Yes.\n",
      "teacher: How come?\n",
      "student: Because 3 is half of 6, and then 16 is just like 16.\n",
      "teacher: Okay.  So 16 stays the same, like Student M says.  3 is half of 6, so you’re saying the answer to this one is half of the answer to the second one.\n",
      "student: Yeah.\n",
      "teacher: Okay.  Does anybody have any story context that we can use to explain that, why the answer to one is half of the answer to another one, or any other thing to say about that? Student M?\n",
      "student: 16 rows of [inaudible].\n",
      "teacher: 16 what?  I didn’t hear you.\n",
      "student: 16 rolls.\n",
      "teacher: 16 rolls?  Rolls?\n",
      "student: Rows.\n",
      "teacher: Rows.  16 rows of something.  What?  Chocolates?  Chocolate bars?  Okay.  16 rows of chocolate bars and what?\n",
      "student: [Inaudible.]\n",
      "teacher: 3 chocolate bars in each row.  Okay.  Did anybody use any other story context when they solved this problem on page 53?  So what is 16 times 3?  What did you come up with for that? What?\n",
      "student: 48.\n",
      "teacher: 48.  So if we’re talking about rows and chocolate bars, we’re talking about 48 chocolate bars.  Okay.  How did you get that, 16 times 3?  Anybody have a strategy for that? Student E?\n",
      "student: 16 times 2.\n",
      "teacher: 16 times 2 is –?\n",
      "student: 32?\n",
      "teacher: 32.  So if you can double one, then what?\n",
      "student: Then you just add 16.\n",
      "teacher: Add another 16, so 16 times 2 is 32, and then add another 16, to get to 48.  Did anybody do it a different way?  Student H?  Student H, can you come over here?  Student H?\n",
      "student: 3 times 10?\n",
      "teacher: 3 times 10.  [Inaudible] the same direction, so we keep it straight. 10 times 3.  Can I do that?  Okay.  Equals –?\n",
      "student: Equals 30.  And 6 times 3.\n",
      "teacher: 6 times 3 equals –?\n",
      "student: 18.\n",
      "teacher: 18.  Then?\n",
      "student: Add the 30 to 18, equals 48.\n",
      "teacher: 30 plus 18 is 48.  In terms of rows and candy bars, what’s the 10 represent, Student C?  This was 16 rows and this was 3 candy bars in each row.\n",
      "student: 10 rows.\n",
      "teacher: 10 rows of candy bars.\n",
      "student: [Inaudible.]\n",
      "teacher: 3 in each.  And then what’s this 6 represent?\n",
      "student: [Inaudible.]\n",
      "teacher: How much what?  Student B?  We have 16 rows of candy bars, 3 in each.  We have 10 rows of candy bars, 3 in each.  6 more rows of candy bars with 3 in each.  Okay.  So if we drew a picture – here’s a row of candy bars.  I’m not going to draw all 16, but I have 3 candy bars in each row.  Okay. What would change if we had 16 times 6?  How would the story context change?  Student A?\n",
      "student: You’d just have more candy bars in each row.\n",
      "teacher: And how many would you have in each row?\n",
      "student: 6.\n",
      "teacher: So now we have 6 in each row, twice as much as Student C said before.  What changes?  If the number of candy bars in each row changes, what else changes?\n",
      "student: The total?\n",
      "teacher: The total number of what?  Of candy bars, chocolate bars, right?  And what is that going to be?\n",
      "student: It’s going to be 6.\n",
      "teacher: It’s going to be 6, double 48.  Okay, 96 candy bars.  So now instead of 3 in each row, we have 6 in each row.  You could also be talking like we did last week about Miss S’ apples, right?  We could have 16 apples in each box, and we have 3 boxes.  Or we could have 3 apples in a box, 16 boxes, right?  All right.  Any other ways that you can show this 16 times 3, and then you double that, that factor, and you get twice as many candy bars or apples or whatever it is.  Student C, can you sit up, please?  Any other way to show that?  Anybody represent it a different way?  Student E?\n",
      "student: Like [inaudible].  And then I just added it.  [Inaudible] so I can do 2 times 8 is 16.\n",
      "teacher: Okay.  You’re giving me another strategy.  What I’m asking for is another way to show, to represent 16 times 3 and 16 times 6, to show that it doubles, the answer doubles.  Did anybody use an array?  You didn’t?\n",
      "student: No.  [We guessed.]\n",
      "teacher: For that one?\n",
      "student: Yes.\n",
      "teacher: That’s a different one, right.  Which one did you show for that one?\n",
      "student: [Inaudible.]\n",
      "teacher: Let’s look at an array for 16 times 3 and 16 times 6.  You can use centimeter paper to do that, and you have one of those. You did [inaudible] on here, or you’ll just want to draw one.  Just want to draw one without this, on the board? Okay.  Now explain to us what you’re doing as you draw. Can you reach?  Make it big enough so that we can see. Thank you.\n",
      "student: [Inaudible.]\n",
      "teacher: Okay.  Tell us what you have.\n",
      "student: 16 [inaudible].\n",
      "teacher: I can’t hear you.\n",
      "student: 16 times 3 [inaudible].\n",
      "teacher: You do?  I see a 6 by 13.\n",
      "student: Oh.\n",
      "teacher: I see a 6 by 3 array.  Okay.  So there’s a 16 by 3 array.  Then the 16 by 6?\n",
      "teacher: Okay.  Thank you.  Have a seat.  Good job.  I’m going to make this a little bigger on this side, so it matches up.  Is that okay?  Can somebody show us – see what he’s doing? He’s taking 16 by 3, doubling that to make it 16 by 6.  Can anybody show us where the 16 by 3 array is inside the 16 by 6 array?  I have the same hands up.  Student B?  Everybody look at it.  See if you can find the 16 by 3 array inside the 16 by 6, and how you could show it to us.\n",
      "student: [Inaudible.]\n",
      "teacher: Can you label it for us?  Okay.  So what did Student B do? Somebody explain that, to show us the 16 by 3 array.\n",
      "student: [Inaudible.]\n",
      "teacher: So just like the 48 is half of 96, 3 is half of 6.  She showed the 16 by 3, and then she could label the other side too, right?  16 by 3 again, so that the total is 16 by 6.  Is the number smaller [inaudible]?\n",
      "multiple students: Yeah.\n",
      "teacher: Same idea, right?\n",
      "teacher: So we have one of these, and make two together can make one of the 16 by 6s, right?  Or if you take this and divide it up into half, you have one of the 16 by 3s.  Very good.  What does this represent in terms of, let’s say, apples and rows, or apples and crates, Miss S?  Student M?\n",
      "student: 16 rows, 3 apples in each.\n",
      "teacher: 16 rows, 3 apples in each row.  What would this one be, then? Student O?\n",
      "student: 16 rows, 6 apples each?\n",
      "teacher: 16 rows, 6 apples in each.  Okay.  Let’s take a look at another one.\n",
      "teacher: Okay.  We have 15 times 8, and which number is this?\n",
      "student: [Half.]\n",
      "teacher: [F?]\n",
      "student: Yeah.\n",
      "teacher: Okay.  15 times 8 and 30 times 4.  What about these two problems.  How did you solve these?  Same hands.  Oh, there we go.  A new one.  Student C?\n",
      "student: For 15 times 8 I did 10 times 8, which is 80, and then I did 5 times 8, which is 40, and then I did 80 plus 40, which is 120.\n",
      "teacher: Very good.  Did everybody hear that?  10 times 8, 80; 5 times 8, 40; 80 plus 40 equals 120.  What about the other one? What did you do for that one?  Student H?\n",
      "student: 30 times 4 is 120.\n",
      "teacher: How did you do that one?\n",
      "student: Because 4 times 20 equals 80, and 80 plus 4 plus [inaudible], and the 30 equals 40, and 80 plus 40 is 120.\n",
      "teacher: Okay.  4 times 20, 80; 4 times 10 is 40; 80 plus 40 is 120. Very good.  Anybody do it a different way?  Student S?\n",
      "student: [Inaudible.]\n",
      "teacher: 3 times 4 equals 12.  30 times 4 equals 120.  Okay.  Did anybody use one to get the other one?  And what is the relationship between these two?  How could you use one of these to get the other one?  Go ahead.\n",
      "student: 15 times 8 is – [inaudible] like 15 plus 15 is 30.  So then you just need to cut the 8 in half, and 30 times 8 is [inaudible].\n",
      "teacher: Okay.  So say that again.  You take the 15 –?\n",
      "student: You just, if you have 15 plus 15, it’s going to be 30.  And then [inaudible] and then you just add 30 times 4, because [inaudible] 15 plus 15 is 30, and if you have 30 four times then it’s going to equal 120.\n",
      "teacher: So [this drew] 15 times 8 equals 30 times 4?\n",
      "multiple students: Yeah.\n",
      "teacher: So I heard Student N say that 15 plus 15 is 30.  So those tow factors are related.  How could you describe how those two factors are related?  Student A?\n",
      "student: You can tell that they’re related because [inaudible] 30, and then [inaudible] four times, get the same problem.  Half of it is 4, and then [inaudible].\n",
      "teacher: So Student J said that 15 plus 15 is 30, so double 15 you get 30, and Student A is saying that if you take half of 8 you get 4, or you double 4 you get 8.  So this goes this way. 15 times 2 is 30, or double 15 is 30.  This goes the other way.  8 divided by 2, or half of 8 equals 4.  Okay.  How about with a story or with an array?  Anybody show it that way?  Want to show it with an array?  Want to do it on the graph paper or just like that?  Student J, [inaudible].\n",
      "teacher: Okay.  Keep going.  You want to show, with these arrays, that 15 times 8 is the same amount as 30 times 4.  How does that show us the same amount?\n",
      "student: It’s just like [inaudible].\n",
      "teacher: Okay.  Do that.  Show us.  If you split the 15 times 8, the 8 part in half, the 8 dimension of the array, what do you get?  Okay.  Label that.  And label the other side.  Okay. Step back so people can see that.  Step to the side right there, is good.  How does that show that 15 times 8 is the same as 30 times 4?  Take a look at both those arrays. Student C?\n",
      "student: Because –\n",
      "teacher: Do you want to go up and point?\n",
      "student: Yes.\n",
      "teacher: Okay.\n",
      "student: 15 is half of 30, and then if you just take 30 and cut it in half –\n",
      "teacher: Sure.\n",
      "student: If you take 30 and cut it in half, you can just, like, pretend it’s like a door and then you can flip it over and then you have 15 by 4 [inaudible].\n",
      "teacher: [Inaudible] on the 30 by 4?  Can you do that?\n",
      "student: Then this would be 8, then you can just put it like that, and this would be 15.\n",
      "teacher: Oh.  So you’re saying you take this, like on a hinge.\n",
      "student: Yeah.\n",
      "teacher: And turn it around this way so that it comes out like that?\n",
      "student: Yes.  And then you [inaudible] 15 by 4 array – I mean, 15 by 8 array.\n",
      "teacher: Very good.  Can everybody see that?  Nice explanation.  Nice job.  Take a bow.\n",
      "student: No.\n",
      "teacher: Okay.  You have 15 by 8 over here and Student M divided it up in half.  So what are the dimensions of this side of the array, Student W?  Look up here.  What are the dimensions of this half of this 15 by 8 array?  4 times 15 or 15 times 4.  On this side, Student E?\n",
      "student: 15 times 4.\n",
      "teacher: 15 times 4 again.  And can somebody explain with Student C did? [Inaudible.]\n",
      "student: He [inaudible] the other side.\n",
      "teacher: So he took the 30 by 4 array and did what?\n",
      "student: And then [inaudible] in half?\n",
      "teacher: He like put it on a hinge and swung it around so that it can go down here.   And then he made a new array here, which was what?  What were the dimensions of this new array he made, Student C?\n",
      "student: 15 times 4 – no, 5.\n",
      "teacher: 15 times what?  Remember, he had 4 on this side and then another 4 now.\n",
      "student: Oh, 8.\n",
      "teacher: 15 times 8, right?  He doubled the size of this and made this size half.  It’s a nice picture.  Let me show it on here where it’s a little easier to see, perhaps. So what Student A did was she took the – excuse me, not Student A – Student M did, was she took a 15 by 4 array like this. Let’s see – one, two, three – 15 by 8 array.  Excuse me. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.  Did I count right? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.  By 8 array.  Now, I don’t know if I’ll be able to fit 8.  It doesn’t look like I’ll be able to fit a 30 by 4 array on here.  All right.  So I have 15 over here, 8 over here. And what Student M did is we took that and divided it right in half. How can we do the opposite thing, from out from Student M’s to show what Student C – how can we go backwards to show Student C’s original 30 by 4 array?  What would we have to do?  Student C took that long 30 by 4 array and made it on a hinge, and put them side by side, right – kind of in half, and then swung it around to make this.  What would we have to do to Student M’s to make Student C’s original one? Student B?\n",
      "student: [Inaudible.]\n",
      "teacher: Take half of it, so we have 15 by 4 and 15 by 4.  And take it around, swing it around, or cut it and move it to the top, right?  So then you’d have a new array that would be pretty big, that would show what?  What would be the dimensions of that new array?  Student D?\n",
      "student: [Inaudible.]\n",
      "teacher: What.\n",
      "student: 30 times 4.\n",
      "teacher: 30 times 4.  I’d take this 4 by 15 and put it up here.  It would still be 4, and then it would be 30 times 4.  Two 15s, right?  Excellent.  In terms of, let’s say, candy bars and rows, or apples and crates, or apples and rows, what would it be?  What could you say?  Student C?\n",
      "student: In terms of apples and chocolate bars?\n",
      "teacher: Chocolate bars and rows, or apples and rows.  Which one do you want to use?\n",
      "student: Oh, apples.\n",
      "teacher: Apples and rows.\n",
      "student: You can take like 15 rows.\n",
      "teacher: 15 rows of –?\n",
      "student: 8.\n",
      "teacher: 8 apples in each row, or –?\n",
      "student: Or –\n",
      "teacher: Student C?  Student J?  Student A?\n",
      "student: 30 rows of apples and 4 each.\n",
      "teacher: Okay.   So here I have 15 rows of apples with 8 in each, or 30 rows of apples with 4 in each, and it would be the same amount of apples.  So what you want to think about is when you’re working on a problem like this, this one is pretty easy to solve, isn’t it?  30 times 4?  3 times 4 is 12, 30 times 4 is 120.  You can use what you know about this to help you solve one like that.  Where one factor is half and the other factor is doubled, it’s going to be the same amount.  If one factor is half, the other one is the same, what’s going to happen with the answer?\n",
      "student: [Inaudible.]\n",
      "teacher: If one factor is half and the other is doubled, the answers are the same.  But if one factor is half, like in the first example – 16 by 3 and 16 by 6 – what happens?\n",
      "student: [Inaudible.]\n",
      "teacher: It will either double or half, depending on which one you do first.  All right.  So when you’re solving hard numbers, and you have this one – 30 times 4 is 120 – you know 15 times 8 is also 120.  If you know 24 times 6 – let’s look at that one.  That’s a harder problem.  Can we use what we know about doubling or halving to help us?  24 times 6.  A little hard to do in your head.  Think about half or doubling any of these.\n",
      "student: 24 times 3?\n",
      "teacher: You could do 24 times 3 if that one’s an easier one for you. That one still seems a bit hard to me, 24 times 3.\n",
      "student: The answer is –\n",
      "teacher: I don’t want to know the answer.  I want to know what other problem you could do.\n",
      "student: 12 times 6.\n",
      "teacher: You can do 12 times 6.  And then what would you have to do?\n",
      "student: [Inaudible.]\n",
      "teacher: And double it.  Right.  12 times 6 to 12 times 6.  Can you change both?\n",
      "multiple students: Yes.\n",
      "teacher: What if you change both?  What would you get?\n",
      "student: 12 times 6.\n",
      "teacher: 12 times 3, you’re taking half of one and half of the other. Remember, we said you take half of one – like 24 times 3 – or you take half of one and double the other.  What if we took half of 24?  What do you get?  Student S?\n",
      "student: 12.\n",
      "teacher: 12.  That means you’d have to double 6.  What would you get?\n",
      "student: 12.\n",
      "teacher: What’s 12 times 12?  A lot of people know that one, have that one memorized.  144.  So if we take half of 24 and get 12, double 6 to get 12, it has to be the same amount.  Right? Let’s see.  What about 35 times 8? 35 times 8.  What could you do to that one?\n",
      "student: You could do 35 times 10.\n",
      "teacher: You could do 35 times 10.\n",
      "student: And then you can –\n",
      "teacher: There’s an easier strategy.  Think about doubling and halving, like we’ve been practicing.  How could you use doubling and halving for this one?  Student C?\n",
      "student: 35 times 4?\n",
      "teacher: 35 times 4.  Can anybody do that in their head?  It’s still a little hard.  What if you just took half of 4?  What if you double 35?  You should get the same answer, right?  You double 35 to get 70.  You take half of 8 to get 4.  What’s your answer there?  70 times 4?\n",
      "student: [Inaudible.]\n",
      "teacher: 7 times 4 is 28.  70 times 4 is 280.  35 times 8 has to be 280, right?  Okay.  So as you work on these pages, 53 and 54, I want you to think about doubling and halving, and how those are related.  As you do some, you might double one factor. Some you might double one and then halve the other.  Also, I want you to work on some more multiplication problems. So we have the cluster problems here.  We have the doubling and halving.  We have the cluster problems on pages 57 and 58, like we talked about on Friday.  Think about any ways you can double and halve to get that.  And then we have more multiplication problems on pages 61 and 62. And, as you get done with those, you can play some of those array games.  The small array, big array, and missing factor. When you’re using the array games, think about how you can double or halve.  Small array, big array, and missing factor. Let’s start with this one.  If you haven’t finished pages 53 and 54, finish those, and then go to 57 and 58.  Finish those cluster problems if you haven’t yet, and as you do it, think about doubling and halving to help you solve part of the problem.\n",
      "teacher: Here.  63 times 10 is 630.  How did you do that?\n",

      "teacher: Okay.  And you did 60 times 11?\n",
      "student: Uh-huh.  60 times 10 [inaudible] one more 60 plus one more 60, and then got [inaudible].  And this one is 3 times 10 and then add 3, this 3 once. [0:39:00]\n",
      "teacher: So which ones are you going to use to help you solve that one?\n",
      "student: 6 times 10.  Like, you just need to add ones, like one 60 [inaudible] that’s it.\n",
      "teacher: Very good.\n",
      "student: Mr. [inaudible] do anything on this?\n",
      "teacher: You can use these graph papers to do any problems you want. But using that graph paper, if you’re going to just do that, you can use scrap paper for that.\n",
      "student: I need to go to the bathroom.\n",
      "teacher: And label that, please, so I can see what you’re doing.\n",
      "teacher: What is the 8 by 4 in this one?  Right.  But where is it here? Because you’re showing that 4 by 8 – when you do these two differently.\n",
      "student: Like [inaudible] other one?\n",
      "teacher: Okay.  So half of it, right?  So this would be 8 and this would be 4.  One suggestion:  when you’re making two different arrays like that and you want to show how they relate to each other, use the dimension, just like we do 4 times 8 and then 4 times 16, the same direction, or 8 times 4 and 16 times 4.  Use the array in the same direction, too, because otherwise it gets confusing, all right?  So here you have 4 by 8 and then you have 4 by 16.  See what I’m doing?  I’m keeping the dimensions the same way, right? So you have 4 by 8 and 4 by 8 together, so this one next to each other.  Here you just made it so that they’re half and half.  I bet you switched these.  Actually, you didn’t just make them sort of half and half.  You made them [inaudible] so that you changed the side, the dimension, perhaps, so it’s hard to see the connection.  Here, it’s much easier to see the connection between them.\n",
      "teacher: Just like we talked about, lots of times when you’re making two different equations that are related, keep them in the same order.  So if you have 4 by 8 and then 4 by 16, keep the same factor of 4 at the beginning, right?  Do the same thing when you’re making arrays, otherwise it gets confusing and hard to see the relationship between the two. Can you do me a favor, and just write down the two equations that you’re working with over here, so you can see it on the same page?\n",
      "teacher: So how does that represent your problem?  How does this represent your problem?\n",
      "student: Because this equals 48.  And then this, I’m just putting half of 6, and then I’m taking the 8 and adding another 8, and then I get like the same answer.\n",
      "teacher: Okay.  So what is this showing us?\n",
      "student: This is showing us 16 by 3 right here.\n",
      "teacher: Oh, so you’re just showing it with one part of the dimensions, right?\n",
      "student: Yeah.\n",
      "teacher: So you don’t have to make the whole thing.\n",
      "student: Yeah.\n",
      "teacher: Wow, that’s pretty good.  You can visualize the other part in your head?\n",
      "teacher: Can you explain what you’re doing with these?  What are the two?  Are you doing [1D]?  So why don’t you write down the two equations, 1D, 9 times 8 and 18 times 4?  So what is this showing here?\n",
      "student: [Inaudible] and 4 is half of 8.\n",
      "teacher: So you said that 9 is half of 18 and 4 is half of 8.  Okay. What’s different about each problem?  You just tell us what’s different, like 9 is half of 18 and 4 is half of 8. What’s the same?\n",
      "student: [Inaudible.]\n",
      "teacher: And the other [fact of that] is how does the first problem help you solve this one?  Think about how – tell us how they’re connected, right?  You’re telling us that this is double that and this is double that, right?  And if [inaudible] other page is the same.\n",
      "teacher: Think about how one helps you with the other and write that down there.  Write down what you just said, the difference, the same, and then answer that third problem.\n",
      "teacher: I see the 8 times 4 here.  I don’t see the 16 times 4.  At least, I don’t see it labeled.  Could you show me that? Show me the 16 times 4 on this?  May I finish that, please? Before you go on to the other ones, you have to do that.\n",
      "student: I need to use the bathroom.\n",
      "teacher: Show me that first.\n",
      "teacher: What’s that?  Oh, I can’t tell what that is.\n",
      "student: [Inaudible.]\n",
      "teacher: I can’t tell that number.  Make it so that we can read it, so that you can read it.  Okay, now remember, we’re looking for other strategies.  Now, what’s the problem you’re trying to reach?  This one, right?\n",
      "student: Yeah.\n",
      "teacher: Okay.  So this is what we want to solve, and you want to find some strategies to help you solve them, like cluster problems we used, but [inaudible] every single one.  You don’t need to do that, all right?  I want you to find more efficient strategies, okay?  So I want you to find a way to do that without going through all of this.\n",
      "teacher: [Inaudible.]  You can keep that first one.  Maybe that’ll help you get this other one.  I want nice, efficient strategies.\n",
      "teacher: Do you see the pictures?\n",
      "student: No.\n",
      "teacher: Do you see the pictures?\n",
      "student: No.\n",
      "teacher: I haven’t seen them yet.\n",
      "teacher: It’s a great one of him.\n",
      "teacher: Student C, are you [inaudible]?\n",
      "student: What does that mean [inaudible]?\n",
      "teacher: What did we talk about last week?  Cluster problems?  Remember? You have the final problem – this is a cluster, a group. Cluster is a group.  You have a group of problems that are helping you to solve that one.  Remember we did that?  Oh, you weren’t here on Friday, right?  A cluster is a group, so this group of problems, you have to solve these first, and then see which of those can help you solve this final problem.  Okay, yeah.  So 36 –So 36 times 2, 72.  We’re trying to reach 36 times 8. What about doubling or halving? Can you use a doubling one?\n",
      "student: Uh-huh.\n",
      "teacher: What?\n",
      "student: 36 times 4.\n",
      "teacher: So you don’t have to do 36 times 3, do you?  Use your fourth grade strategy.  Because the more of those problems you do, and if you mess up on one of them, then you mess up on all the rest, right?\n",
      "student: Yes.\n",
      "teacher: You are sparklies.  Okay?  So try 36 times 4.  Use your strategies – doubling, halving, breaking numbers apart. All right.  I want to see just – skip counting [inaudible] to 47 times, or anything like that, right?\n",
      "student: Uh huh.  [Inaudible.]\n",
      "teacher: Oh.\n",
      "student: Can I go to the bathroom?\n",
      "teacher: What?\n",
      "student: [Inaudible.]\n",
      "teacher: So what should you do?  Get to work.  Get to work, please. What are the two problems you’re trying to solve here? Could you write those down?\n",
